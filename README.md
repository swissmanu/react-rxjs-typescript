# react-rxjs-typescript

> ðŸ—º An experiment to implement a React user interface using TypeScript that leverages RxJS.
>
> Thesis to proof: Can a reactive application state be implemented using RxJS to drive a web user interface?

## Things to Explore

* [x] Use RxJS streams to model centralized state store
* [x] Use functional programming approaches to implement/improve action/reducer concepts known from Redux
* [x] Support synchronous reducers
* [ ] Support asynchronous reducers

## Usage

```bash
yarn # install dependencies
yarn start # run development server on localhost:3000
yarn test # run test suite
```
